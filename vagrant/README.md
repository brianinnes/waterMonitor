# Water Monitor - test runtime

This directory contains a vagrant file which runs the backend environment for the water monitor.
This is available for a test environment.

The vagrant file installs a mosquitto broker, with the TLS/SSL configuration and certificates.  The broker authentication is enabled with the credentials:

- username: mosquitto  
- password: passw0rd  

MQTT client will be able to access the broker using port 8883 on the IP Address of the system running the virtual machine.  The CA certificate needed to verify the SSL connection will be available in the **vagrant** directory.  However, the code has comments to enable or disable the server certificate validation, which may not be possible if the host system hostname is not resolvable in DNS.

A NoSQL database, couchDB, is also installed, which is where data is saved to.  The console can be found at [http://127.0.0.1:5984/_utils/](http://127.0.0.1:5984/_utils/)

- username : admin
- password : passw0rd

The Vagrant VM also hosts Node-RED, which implements the back end functionality.

- The editor is available [http://localhost:1880](http://localhost:1880)
- The dashboard is available [http://localhost:1880/ui/#/0](http://localhost:1880/ui/#/0)

## Using the vagrant file

To use the vagrant file you need:

- An up to date installation of [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org)  
- An up to date installation of [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com)  

On a command line in this directory you can use the following commands:
  
- **vagrant up** - Starts the virtual machine (creates it is necessary)
- **vagrant ssh** - ssh into the running virtual machine  
- **vagrant destroy** - stops and deletes the virtual machine (note - certificates will be different next time *vagrant up* is used and the database will be lost)
- **vagrant suspend** - suspends the running virtual machine  
- **vagrant resume** - resume a suspended virtual machine  
- **vagrant halt** - stops a running virtual machine
